It's a <span class='bold'>school project revolving around disability</span>, specifically cerebro-injuries. <br/><br/> For this project, I worked with two designers: <a href='https://www.instagram.com/rever.dsgn/' target='_blank' class='bold small-links'>Baptiste SINHSATTANAK <i class='fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square'></i></a> and  <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/clarissegrely/' target='_blank' class='bold small-links'>Clarisse GRÃ‰LY <i class='fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square'></i></a>. We had to build an object or a game <span class='bold'>to help people with disabilities</span> to socialize or to <span class='bold'>make their everyday life easier</span>. After a few interviews with people from an association, we noticed that for those in electric wheelchairs, it was often <span class='bold'>difficult to make half-turns or to go backward</span> without running into an obstacle, mainly because <span class='bold'>they couldn't turn their heads.</span>",
